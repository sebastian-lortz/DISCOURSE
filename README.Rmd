I introduce the DISCOURSE framework – Data-simulation via Iterative Stochastic Combinatorial Optimization Using Reported Summary Estimates. The primary scope of the algorithmic framework is to reconstruct complete datasets using only summary statistics, giving researchers a way - when raw data are unavailable - to conduct follow-up analyses and inform replication study decision‑making.

## Usage

The method is available as R package and comprehensive ShinyApp.

### Web App

You can use the app at [https://sebastian-lortz.shinyapps.io/discourse/](https://sebastian-lortz.shinyapps.io/discourse/). Expect longer computation time compared to running the app locally.


### System Requirements

The 'discourse' package was build under R Version 4.4.2 using Apple clang version 14.0.0 (clang-1400.0.29.202) and GNU Fortran (GCC) 14.2.0. To compile R from source, install the appropriate toolchain  
 - macOS: see https://mac.r-project.org/tools/  
 - windows: see https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/

### Installation

You can install the latest version of the R package `discourse` like so:

```{r install-from-github, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
# install devtools if needed
if (!requireNamespace("devtools")) {install.packages("devtools")}

# install from GitHub
devtools::install_github("sebastian-lortz/discourse")

```

### Run

You can launch the ShinyApp locally by running:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
discourse::run_app()
```

## Citation

Please cite `discourse` if you use it. To cite the software, use: 

```{r echo = FALSE, results = "asis"}
print(citation("discourse"), style = "text")
```

Or copy the reference information to your BibTeX file:

```bibtex
@Manual{discourse,
  title        = {discourse: Data‐simulation via Iterative Stochastic Combinatorial Optimization Using Reported Summary Estimates},
  author       = {S. A. J. Lortz},
  year         = {2025},
  note         = {R package version 0.0.1.000},
  url          = {https://github.com/sebastian-lortz/discourse}
}
```
