I introduce the DISCOURSE framework – Data-simulation via Iterative Stochastic Combinatorial Optimization Using Reported Summary Estimates. The primary scope of the algorithmic framework is to reconstruct complete datasets using only summary statistics, giving researchers a way - when raw data are unavailable - to inform replication study decision‑making.

## Usage

The method is available as R package discourse and comprehensive ShinyApp. The corresponding research article can be found [HERE] (https://example.com/research_article.pdf) soon.

### Web App

You can use the app at [https://sebastian-lortz.shinyapps.io/discourse/](https://sebastian-lortz.shinyapps.io/discourse/). Expect longer computation time compared to running the app locally.


### Installation

You can install the latest version of the R package `{discourse}` like so:

```{r install-from-github, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
# install devtools if you don’t have it yet
if (!requireNamespace("devtools")) {install.packages("devtools")}

# install from GitHub
devtools::install_github("sebastian-lortz/discourse")

```

### Run

You can launch the ShinyApp locally by running:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
discourse::run_app()
```

## Citation

Please cite `discourse` if you use it. To cite the software, use: 

```{r echo = FALSE, results = "asis"}
print(citation("discourse"), style = "text")
```

Or copy the reference information to your BibTeX file:

~~~bibtex

```{r echo = FALSE, results = "asis"}
print(citation("discourse"), style = "Bibtex")
```
