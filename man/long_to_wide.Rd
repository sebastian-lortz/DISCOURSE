\title{Reshape Data from Long to Wide Format}
\usage{
long_to_wide(data)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A \code{data.frame} in long format.  The first column is taken as the
subject identifier (\code{ID}); the next columns before \code{time} are treated as
between‐subject factors; the \code{time} column must be named \code{"time"}; remaining
columns are the measurements.}
}
\value{
A \code{data.frame} in wide format, with one row per subject (and between‐subject
  factor combination) and one column per measure–time combination.
}
\description{
Converts a data.frame in long format (with an \code{ID} column, optional between-subject
grouping columns, a \code{time} column, and one or more measurement columns) into
wide format.  Column names in the result follow the pattern \code{<measure>_<time>}.
