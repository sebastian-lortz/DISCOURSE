\title{Check plausibility of a reported mean with the GRIM test (Brown & Heathers 2007)}
\usage{
check_grim(n, target_mean, decimals, tol.r = .Machine$double.eps^0.5)
}
\arguments{
\item{n}{Integer. Sample size; a positive whole number.}

\item{target_mean}{Numeric. Reported mean to be tested for plausibility.}

\item{decimals}{Integer. Number of decimal places in the reported mean.}

\item{tol.r}{Numeric. Tolerance for rounding errors; a non-negative value. Default is the square root of machine double precision epsilon.}
}
\value{
A list with components:
\describe{
  \item{test}{Logical. TRUE if the reported mean is plausible.}
  \item{grim_mean}{Numeric. The adjusted mean that is numerically plausible (rounded to `decimals`).}
}
}
\description{
Performs the GRIM (Granularity-Related Inconsistency of Means) test to assess
whether a reported mean is numerically possible given the sample size.
