\title{Plot Summary of Simulated vs. Target Statistics for a discourse.object}
\usage{
plot_summary(discourse_obj, standardised = TRUE, eps = 1e-12)
}
\arguments{
\item{discourse_obj}{A `discourse.object` produced by `optim_*` functions,
containing both simulated data/results and `inputs$target_*` values.}

\item{standardised}{Logical; if `TRUE`, differences are divided by target values
(except when targets are near zero); default `TRUE`.}

\item{eps}{Numeric; threshold below which a target is treated as zero for standardisation;
default `1e-12`.}
}
\value{
A `ggplot2` object.
}
\description{
Visualizes discrepancies between simulated and target summary statistics
(e.g., means, SDs, F-values, correlations, regression coefficients) for a single `discourse.object`.
