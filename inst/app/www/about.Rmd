### About the project

I introduce **DISCOURSE** â€“ this algorithmic framework is designed to reconstruct complete data sets solely from summary statistics.  It provides researchers with a tool to follow-up analyses even when raw data are unavailable. DISCOURSE is available as R package and shiny app via Github page: <https://sebastian-lortz.github.io/discourse/>

### Publications

The method is introduced in the research project titled 'Advancing Replication Study Decision-Making with DISCOURSE: Data-simulation via Iterative Stochastic Combinatorial Optimization Using Reported Summary Estimates'.
